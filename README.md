# 3d Knob Design

**FREECAD**

Freecad is a free software for 3D drawing : https://www.freecad.org/

It allowed me to draw a model that you can modify the inner diameter, the shape and the outer diameter.
You will find them in the 3D files folder.

Here a screen shot of freecad, with the final result
